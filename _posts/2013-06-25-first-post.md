Absolutely! My favorite use case of unit testing is to use it as a feedback tool while coding. I am primarily into
web development and in my world, to see my code in action it gets to perform quite a few actions <!-- more --> including
compiling my code, creating an executable, starting the web server, deploying the executable to the server, opening the
application within a web browser, navigating to the corresponding page/section and finally i get to validate the few
lines of code that was coded.
